This is a Hugo website.


------

This used to be a Github Pages site, powered by Jekyll

I was following https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll and https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll since I wanted to also preview the site locally

But then I ran into this error:

https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/issues/990

And after fucking around with terminal commands for a while I realized I just never want to deal with Ruby again. I figured out that it had to do with the version of Ruby I got from `chruby` missing something or something, but I'm good ðŸ˜‚. I'm not dealing with that.
